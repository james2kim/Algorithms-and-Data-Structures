Rosetta Code: Identity matrix


An identity matrix is a square matrix of size  n×nn×n , where the diagonal elements are all 1s (ones), and all the other elements are all 0s (zeroes).

In=⎡⎣⎢⎢100010001⎤⎦⎥⎥In=[100010001] 


Write a function that takes a number n as a parameter and returns the identity matrix of order  n×nn×n .
