Rosetta Code: Ethiopian multiplication


Ethiopian multiplication is a method of multiplying integers using only addition, doubling, and halving.

Method:

1. Take two numbers to be multiplied and write them down at the top of two columns
2. In the left-hand column repeatedly halve the last number, discarding any remainders, and write the result below the last in the same column, until you write a value of 1
3. In the right-hand column repeatedly double the last number and write the result below. stop when you add a result in the same row as where the left hand column shows 1
4. Examine the table produced and discard any row where the value in the left column is even
5. Sum the values in the right-hand column that remain to produce the result of multiplying the original two numbers together
