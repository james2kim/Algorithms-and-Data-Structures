Rosetta Code: Greatest subsequential sum


Given a sequence of integers, find a continuous subsequence which maximizes the sum of its elements, that is, the elements of no other single subsequence add up to a value larger than this one.

An empty subsequence is considered to have the sum of  00 ; thus if all elements are negative, the result must be the empty sequence.
