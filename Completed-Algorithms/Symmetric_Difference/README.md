Rosetta Code: Symmetric difference



Given two sets A and B, compute  (A∖B)∪(B∖A).  That is, enumerate the items that are in A or B but not both. This set is called the symmetric difference of A and B. In other words:  (A∪B)∖(A∩B)  (the set of items that are in at least one of A or B minus the set of items that are in both A and B).

Write a function that takes two arrays as parameters and returns the symmetric difference. Sort the resultant array before returning it.
