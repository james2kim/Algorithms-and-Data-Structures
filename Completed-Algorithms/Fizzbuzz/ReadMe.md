Rosetta Code: FizzBuzz


Write a program that generates an array of integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). But:

for multiples of 3, add "Fizz" to the array instead of the number
for multiples of 5, add "Buzz" to the array instead of the number
for multiples of 3 and 5, add "FizzBuzz" to the array instead of the number
Your program should return an array containing the results based on the rules above.
