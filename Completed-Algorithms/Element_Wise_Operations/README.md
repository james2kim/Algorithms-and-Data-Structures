Rosetta Code: Element-wise operations


Implement basic element-wise matrix-matrix and scalar-matrix operations.

Implement:

addition
subtraction
multiplication
division
exponentiation
The first parameter will be the operation to be performed, for example, "m_add" for matrix addition and "s_add" for scalar addition. The second and third parameters will be the matrices on which the operations are to be performed.
