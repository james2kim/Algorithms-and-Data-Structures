# Palindromes of Anagrams 

Write a function that takes in a string and checks to see if any anagram of that string is a palindrome. Return true if any anagram of a string is a palindrome, 
otherwise, return false


// Palindrome: a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.
// Ex) "racecar" is a palindrome because it is spelled the same forward and backward 

// Anagram: An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.[1] 
// Ex ) "iceman" is an anagram of "cinema"
