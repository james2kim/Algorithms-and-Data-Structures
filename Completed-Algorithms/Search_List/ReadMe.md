Rosetta Code: Search a list of records



A record consists of attributes that describe an entity. Each attribute has a name and a value. For example, a person can have an attribute age with a value of 25. An important operation on a list of records is to find a record with a particular attribute value.



Write a function that takes a string as a parameter. The function should return the index of the item in list for which the value of the name attribute matches the given string.
