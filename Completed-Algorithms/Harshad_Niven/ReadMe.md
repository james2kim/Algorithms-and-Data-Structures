Rosetta Code: Harshad or Niven series
The Harshad or Niven numbers are positive integers â‰¥ 1 that are divisible by the sum of their digits.

For example, 42 is a Harshad number as 42 is divisible by (4 + 2) without remainder.

Assume that the series is defined as the numbers in increasing order.

Implement a function to generate successive members of the Harshad sequence.

Use it to list the first twenty members of the sequence and list the first Harshad number greater than 1000.
