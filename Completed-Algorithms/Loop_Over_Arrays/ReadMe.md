# Rosetta Code: Loop over multiple arrays simultaneously


Loop over multiple arrays and create a new array whose  ithith  element is the concatenation of  ithith  element of each of the given.

For this example, if you are given this array of arrays:

[ ["a", "b", "c"], ["A", "B", "C"], [1, 2, 3] ]

the output should be:

["aA1","bB2","cC3"]

Write a function that takes an array of arrays as a parameter and returns an array of strings satisfying the given description.
