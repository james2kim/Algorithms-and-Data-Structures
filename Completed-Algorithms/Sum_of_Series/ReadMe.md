# Sum of a series
Compute the nth term of a series, i.e. the sum of the n first terms of the corresponding sequence. Informally this value, or its limit when n tends to infinity, is also called the sum of the series, thus the title of this task. For this task, use:  Sn=∑k=1n1k2 .

Write a function that take  a  and  b  as parameters and returns the sum of  ath  to  bth  members of the sequence.
